# **Final Post**
This is the final post in the series of posts describing the work done in GSoC.

## **Work Done**
In the final coding period, I wrote documentation explaining how one can use this project and how to use pytorch and the two frameworks(dgl and pytorch geometric) to develop machine learning models to apply on a graph dataset. I also developed an API for predicting scores for Social Scenarios. Finally, after testing the code and adding documentation I got the code merged into the a Robocomp repository which is linked below.

## **Final Work Product**

### **SNGNN: [Github Repository](https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn)**

  * Pull Request : [Link](https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn/pull/1)


### **Graph Neural Network Models: [Github Repository Link](https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn/tree/master/models)**


### **Robocomp Agents: [Github Repository Link](https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn/tree/master/robocomp_agm)**


### **Social Navigation Scoring API: [Github Repository Link](https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn/tree/master/sndgAPI.py)**

## Future Scope
1. Develop manual editor for the social scenario
2. Add more functionality to the Social Navigation API

## Learnings
This experience has given me immense learnings:
1. Write clean code and develop solutions which are complete without using any work-arounds
2. Using git effectively
3. Writing documentation
4. Designing good structured code which is extensible
5. Work in a collaborative environment which required soft skills
6. Develop machine learning models in pytorch

Finally I would like to thank my mentor, Luis for all the help and guidance.
